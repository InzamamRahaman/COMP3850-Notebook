# COMP3850-Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for COMP3850

This repo contains Python code that implements all of the algorithms tested in the assignments.
The code that implements the tested search methods can be run from the command line. However, 
note that you would need to modify the contents of main.py to see the results. Moreover, pay attention to the 
API for the informed vs uninformed search methods - the latter does not return a cost.

The rest of the code is implemented as Jupyter notebooks for easy perusal
